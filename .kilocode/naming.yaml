file_folder_naming:
  - src/routes: Contains route registration and API endpoint definitions.
  - src/controllers: Contains business logic for each route group (DiscoveryController, PTZController, etc.).
  - src/services: Contains ONVIF protocol handlers, event logic, and device wrappers.
  - src/models: Sequelize models for persistent storage.
  - src/utils: Utility modules for ONVIF, logging, and topic parsing.
variable_class_naming:
  - Classes use PascalCase (e.g., DiscoveryController, CameraEventService).
  - Variables and functions use camelCase (e.g., getDeviceKey, startUdpDiscovery).
  - Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_RETRIES, DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT).
route_naming:
  - RESTful, resource-oriented (e.g., /devices/discover, /devices/:deviceId/ptz/status).
device_naming_logic:
  - Devices are keyed by a combination of address/URN and xaddr (see getDeviceKey, getDeviceKeyFromNodeOnvif).
  - Device fields: address, xaddrs, types, scopes, manufacturer, model_name, ipv4, ipv4_path, ipv4_port.
