design_choices:
  - All async operations use async/await for clarity and error handling.
  - RESTful API design for all endpoints.
  - Modular code layout: routes, controllers, services, models, utils.
  - Device discovery uses both UDP multicast and node-onvif library for robustness.
  - Event handling is separated into wrappers and handlers for maintainability.
library_usage:
  - express: HTTP server and routing
  - sequelize: ORM for MySQL device/event storage
  - node-onvif, @agsh/onvif: ONVIF protocol and device discovery
  - dotenv: Environment variable management
  - log4js: Logging
  - uuid: Unique ID generation
  - xml2js, soap: XML and SOAP parsing for ONVIF
