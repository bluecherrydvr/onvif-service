rest_patterns:
  - All endpoints use RESTful naming and HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for actions/commands).
  - Device-specific actions use /devices/:deviceId/ for scoping.
  - Event-related routes are mounted from eventRoutes (see EventRoutes.ts for details).
naming_conventions:
  - Plural nouns for resource collections (e.g., /devices)
  - Action or subresource as suffix (e.g., /ptz/status, /ptz/relative)
